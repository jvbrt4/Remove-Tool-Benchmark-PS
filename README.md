# Remove-Tool-Benchmark-PS

A simple action to test out the performance of the Remove Tool across different systems.

Usage: Due to limitations in Photoshop, some steps need to be set up manually.

    1. Select the Remove Tool from the User Interface.
    2. Set the Remove Tool brush size to 600 from the toolbar.
    3. Make sure the Info panel is opened and that timing is turned on in the panel options.
    4. Run the action 3 times while writing down individual results then calculate the average time.
